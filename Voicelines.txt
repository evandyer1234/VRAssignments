Okay, lets rip off this band-aid right now,
no this is not actually a mirror emporium.
It's a shipping company, but a shady one at that.
I just said it was a mirror emporium so you'd be 
more excited.
Heist of the sketchy shipping company just doesn't 
have the same ring to it.
There should be quite a few mirrors in there though.
Ya see, I have shipped 753 mirrors through them 
over the last 4 days, at least some of them should 
still be there.
Just in case you're wondering, I sent all of these
mirrors to vampire models. I thought that if anyone
needed to see how they look in a mirror, it's them.
So ya know, they can see how...they look...in...the...
oh...

Ah there's one now, wave to that handsome devil man,
or woman. I never really thought to ask you that.

ah jeez! hold on!
okay, hug the wall to your right and move carefully.
If that thing sees you we're done for. Well I'll be

See if you can find away around him.

Man these people are about as organized as two-year-olds.
ya gotta get down real low.

Careful, this one rotates. Look at the mirrors to see what
direction he's facing and go when his back is turned.

looks like the stairs are being gaurded, try the air vent.

Nice work! I mean, not as good as I would have done obviously,
but not bad. Lets keep moving.

HOLY CRAP! These people do know they are supposed to be
SHIPPING things right?!

Ok you're going to want to take a right (4x)
