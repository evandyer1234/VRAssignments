Okay, lets rip off this band-aid right now,
no this is not actually a mirror emporium.
It's a shipping company, but a shady one at that.
I just said it was a mirror emporium so you'd be

have the same ring to it.
There should be quite a few mirrors in there though.
Ya see, I have shipped 753 mirrors through them 
over the last 4 days, at least some of them should 
still be there.
Just in case you're wondering, I sent all of these
mirrors to vampire models. I thought that if anyone

Nice work! I mean, not as good as I would have done obviously,
but not bad. Lets keep moving.

HOLY CRAP! These people do know they are supposed to be
SHIPPING things right?!
